# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to my Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025 repository. This repo contains all my practical exercises, homework, projects, and notes for the course organized by DataTalks.Club. The aim is to learn end-to-end ML engineering, from data exploration to model deployment.

I am participating in this free, hands-on course to build real-world ML skills through project-based learning. You will find code, notebooks, and explanations structured by modules and projects.

## Project Structure

* `01-intro/` — Module 1: Introduction and setup
* `02-linreg/` — Module 2: Linear Regression
* `03-classification/` — Module 3: Classification
* `04-evaluation/` — Module 4: Model Evaluation
* `05-deployment/` — Module 5: Model Deployment
* `data/` — Datasets used throughout the course

## How to Use

* Each module folder contains code files, notebooks, and notes related to that week's learning.
* The `data/` folder includes datasets used for exercises and homework.
* Run Python scripts or notebooks in the order of module numbering for smooth progress.
* Make sure to check `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files like virtual environments or data dumps.
